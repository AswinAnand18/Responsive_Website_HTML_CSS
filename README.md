# Responsive_Website_HTML_CSS
Here's an example of a sample website where the HTML and CSS code are separated into separate files.
In this example, the HTML code is placed in the index.html file, and the CSS code is placed in the styles.css file. The HTML file includes a <link> tag in the <head> section to reference the external CSS file.

The CSS code in styles.css defines various styles for different sections of the website, such as header, navigation, main content, and footer.

Ensure that both the index.html and styles.css files are in the same directory for the links to work properly. Open the index.html file in a web browser, and the styles defined in styles.css will be applied to the HTML elements, resulting in the styled website.
